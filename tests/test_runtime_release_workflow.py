"""Regression tests for the signed desktop runtime release workflow.

The desktop runtime is a frozen PyInstaller executable, so it CANNOT
lazy-install dependencies at first use (no working pip inside the binary).
Every backend the desktop exposes must therefore be pre-baked via the
``cn-desktop`` aggregate extra and collected by PyInstaller. These tests pin
that contract so a backend can't silently drop out of the build again —?the
failure mode behind issue #16 (MCP) and the 飞书/钉钉/企微/微信 desktop reports.
